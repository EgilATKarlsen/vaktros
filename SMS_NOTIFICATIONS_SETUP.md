## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Twilio Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
```

You can find these values in your [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/).

### Step 2: Update Database Schema

The system includes a new `user_profiles` table. Run the database initialization:

```bash
npm run db:init
```

Or manually execute the SQL in `src/lib/db/schema.sql` which includes:

```sql
-- Create user_profiles table for additional user information
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profiles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Stack Auth user ID
  phone_number VARCHAR(20),
  sms_notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/dashboard/profile` to set up your phone number

3. Create a test ticket to verify SMS notifications work

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Check Twilio credentials in environment variables
   - Verify phone number format (+1234567890)
   - Check Twilio account balance
   - Review server logs for Twilio API errors

2. **Phone Number Validation Errors**:
   - Ensure phone numbers include country code
   - Remove spaces, dashes, parentheses
   - Use international format (e.g., +1234567890)

3. **No Team Members Receiving SMS**:
   - Verify team members have set up phone numbers
   - Check that SMS notifications are enabled in profiles
   - Confirm users are part of the correct team

### Error Codes

The system handles common Twilio error codes:
- `21211` - Invalid phone number
- `21608` - Phone number is not SMS capable  
- `21614` - SMS to this number is not allowed

## üö¶ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Phone Number Setup**:
   - Add/update phone number in profile
   - Toggle SMS notifications on/off
   - Verify profile updates successfully

2. **Test Ticket Creation Notifications**:
   - Create a new support ticket
   - Check that all team members with phone numbers receive SMS
   - Verify message content and format

3. **Test Status Change Notifications**:
   - Update ticket status (Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved ‚Üí Closed)
   - Check that SMS notifications are sent for each change
   - Verify message includes old and new status

### Production Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Twilio has rate limits - consider implementing queues for high-volume usage
2. **Cost Management**: SMS messages cost money - monitor usage and implement cost controls
3. **International SMS**: Consider costs and regulations for international SMS
4. **Opt-out Compliance**: Ensure compliance with SMS regulations (TCPA, etc.)

## üîê Security Notes

- API endpoints require authentication

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

Monitor these metrics:

## üéØ Next Steps

- SMS templates for different notification types
- Scheduled SMS reminders for open tickets
- SMS-based ticket status updates (reply to SMS)
- Integration with other notification channels (email, Slack)
- SMS notification preferences per ticket priority/category
